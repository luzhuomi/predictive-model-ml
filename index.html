<h1> Module Name: Predictive Modelling and Machine Learning </h1>
<h2> Synopsis:</h2>
<p>This course introduces the principles, theories and concepts of statistics and data modelling.
Students will learn how to construct and interpret graphical presentations of data, conduct
appropriate statistical tests, use the appropriate techniques in data modelling and interpret
the results generated. The students will be applying these statistics and data modelling
techniques in practical projects, through which they will learn how to develop real world
analytics solutions using Spark Machine Learning and Scala. </p>
